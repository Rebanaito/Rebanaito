- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Rebanaito! A former School 21 student, I currently study programming at 42 Wolfsburg.
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in developing backend systems, with my goal being to eventually work on some great technology that either deals with big data or task-specific AI.
- ğŸŒ± I know a little bit of C and Go, and am currently learning Java.
